# Heart-Disease-Classification
Heart disease prediction using various ML models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, Stacking, XGBoost, Random Forests and an MLP. Includes data clustering for analysis on Framingham heart dataset.

#### Project Description:
Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality in the United States, emphasizing the need for effective prediction and 
detection methods. Physicians face challenges in identifying specific causes due to the involvement of various risk factors, 
necessitating multiple tests and information. Building classification models using patient data can assist in determining the 
significant features for diagnosing heart disease and reducing unnecessary tests. Early detection through these models can 
facilitate timely management, reducing the need for invasive procedures. The project aims to develop accurate machine learning 
models for predicting heart disease and explore trends and important features through unsupervised clustering using two datasets: 
the Cleveland Heart dataset with 14 attributes and the Framingham Heart Study dataset with 39 features and a larger sample size.
